A set of exception classes designed to model the error conditions that
frequently arise in enterprise web applications and web services. The
root class is the EnterpriseSecurityException and all the other
exception classes extend this basic class. The
EnterpriseSecurityException automatically logs a message in the
constructor so that a full set of security events are captured in the
logs.

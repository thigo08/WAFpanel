This package contains reference implementations of the ESAPI interfaces. These are intended to
serve as examples of how your enterprise might implement these functions. The reference implementations
are high quality and pass all of the ESAPI test cases. Many of the reference implementations are
likely to be useful in your enterprise without change (Validator, Encoder, Encryptor, etc...).
Implementing other classes (Authenticator, User, AccessController, Logger, etc...) will likely need to
be customized for your enterprise, to integrate with your backend systems and policies.
